#API week project

Live version: https://fac10.github.io/week3-jzlp/

##Exploring APIs

- Giphy
- OpenWeather
- Nekudo (geolocation)

##Process

- Mini technical spike --> do APIs work and have the information we need

###Architecture

- Draw diagram showing individual components
- Discuss how individual components will work together

###Considering your user journey

- As a person who needs to know the weather, I want to go to a web page and see the weather in my area
- As an impatient person, I don't want to have to input anything
- As a person who likes gifs, I would like to see a gif

###Deciding what you need to build for your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and splitting up the tasks

##Stretch goal
- Have a search bar to check the weather somewhere else (i.e. search by city)
